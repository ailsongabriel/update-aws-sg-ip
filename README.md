# üîê AWS Security Group IP Auto-Updater (PowerShell)

This PowerShell script automatically updates the IP address of a specified AWS Security Group rule (e.g., for MySQL, RDP, or SSH access), based on your machine's current public IP address.

---

## üí° Why This Script Exists

If your public IP address changes frequently (for example, in a home or office with a dynamic IP), accessing AWS resources like EC2 instances or databases becomes frustrating ‚Äî you constantly have to manually update the IP in the security group to maintain access.

This script automates that process by:
- Detecting your current public IP address
- Updating the AWS Security Group to allow access from that IP
- (Optionally) Revoking the previous IP rule
- Storing the last used IP locally to avoid redundant updates

---

## üìå Features

- Fully automated using PowerShell and AWS CLI
- Works for any TCP port (MySQL, SSH, RDP, etc.)
- Minimal configuration required
- Can be scheduled to run daily via Windows Task Scheduler

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- [PowerShell 5.1+](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)
  - Required permissions:
    - `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress`
    - `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`

## üöÄ Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script file:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/ailsongabriel/update-aws-sg-ip.git
   cd update-aws-sg-ip

2. Open `update-aws-sg-ip.ps1` and edit the following variables:

   ```powershell
   $securityGroupId = "sg-1234567890ABCDEFG"  # Replace with your actual security group ID
   $protocol = "tcp" # Change to the protocol you need (tcp, udp, etc.)
   $port = 3306  # Change this to the port you want to allow (e.g., 3389 for RDP, 22 for SSH)
   ```

3. Run the script manually to test:

   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\update-sg-ip.ps1
   ```

4. (Optional) Schedule it using Windows Task Scheduler for automatic daily execution.

## üïí Task Scheduler Setup (Windows)

1. Open **Task Scheduler** ‚Üí **Create Task**
2. Under **General**:

   * Name: `Update AWS Security Group IP`
   * Run with highest privileges
3. Under **Triggers**:

   * Add ‚Üí Daily ‚Üí Select your preferred time
4. Under **Actions**:

   * Program/script:

     ```
     powershell.exe
     ```
   * Add arguments:

     ```
     -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\update-sg-ip.ps1"
     ```

## üìÇ Notes

* The script stores the last known IP in `ip.txt` (same folder).
* If `ip.txt` is missing, the script will simply authorize the current IP.
